I made an app that behaves like iPhone app Contacts.It displays contacts. You can edit your contacts so change a name, zip code, address, and phone numbers and email addresses. And you can add and remove phone numbers and email addresses. Since it is a trial version, it does not cover all the functions such as adding and deleting contacts.

### Scroll and display an input control hidden behind the keyboard

When the keyboard is appered, If a text field is hidden behind it , move the scroll view upwards to display the text field so you can enter text.

### Confirm deletion of a cell of table view
When you tap a delete button to delete a phone number or email address, a delete confirmation button slides out. If you tap the button, the record will be deleted, and if you tap the area other than the button, the process will be cancelled.
