I made an app that behaves like iPhone app Contacts.It displays contacts. You can edit your contacts so change a name, zip code, address, and phone numbers and email addresses. And you can add and remove phone numbers and email addresses. Since it is a trial version, it does not cover all the functions such as adding and deleting contacts.

### Scroll and display an input control hidden behind the keyboard
